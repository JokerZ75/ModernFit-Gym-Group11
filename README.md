<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our client is ModernFit Gym from Sheffield. Is looking to **_move from a paper-based records system to a modern digital alternative_**.
They pride themselves on fitness and health with several seasoned specialists offering nutritional guidance. The software should allow members and staff alike to sign up to the gym and will provide them with pins to enter gym locations. It will also allow for the gym’s specialists to have digital records of members, who can submit logs of meals and workouts, allowing specialists to provide programs and diets through the software to gym members. The software should follow WCAG 2 guidelines and allow notifications of any planned maintenance. This software is also planned to be used in more than one geographical location.

<!-- TECH DEMO --> 
## Demo Site

There is a tech demo for the site setup, the frontend has been hosted for free on vercel as it uses next.js.
The backend is running in an AWS EC2 instance using docker-compose to set up the web server.
**ITS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE DEMO BELOW HAS SOME SMALL FIXES AND EDITS THAT AREN'T SHOWN IN THIS REPO AS THEY WERE NEEDED TO MAKE IT WORK HOSTING ON VERCEL**
When signing up we also suggest not using any real personal info as this is a demo and is bound to have some issues somewhere in its current state
So phone numbers can be fake as they have no real use
Temp emails can be made with sites like https://tempail.com/en/

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
* It may also be beneficial to get docker as this is how we will show you how to get the application running

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JokerZ75/ModernFit-Gym-Group11
   ```
2. Create environment variables
    - In the directory /frontend
        - Create a .env file
        - In the file add
          ```sh
          NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001 (IF YOUR NOT USING THE DOCKER COMPOSE YOU CAN USE WHATEVER PORT YOU LIKE AS LONG AS ITS THE ONE UR BACKEND IS RUNNING ON)
          ```
    - In the directory /backend/src
        - Create a .env file
        - In the file you'll need
          ```sh
          MONGO_URI=<Your Mongodb URI>
          TOKEN_SECRET=<can be anything you want, recommend generating long hex string>
          REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=<can be anything you want, recommend generating long hex string>
          PORT=<port you want the backend to run on>
          EMAIL_PASSWORD=<google gmail app password (for gmail used as EMAIL_USER)>
          EMAIL_USER=<google gmail>
          ```
3. Now go to /backend directory
4. If you have docker installed you should be able to run
```sh
docker compose up --build
```
5. This will launch the backend in a docker container
6. Then in a new terminal go to /frontend and run
```sh
npm install
```
7. Then run
```sh
npm run dev
```
8. The frontend should now also be running on localhost:3000 and you can use the application
9. You could also run them individually using npm if you like. For the backend, you will require Redis (https://redis.io/docs/install/)
