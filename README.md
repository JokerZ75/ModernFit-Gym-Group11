<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our client is ModernFit Gym from Sheffield. Is looking to **_move from a paper-based records system to a modern digital alternative_**.
They pride themselves on fitness and health with several seasoned specialists offering nutritional guidance. The software should allow members and staff alike to sign up to the gym and will provide them with pins to enter gym locations. It will also allow for the gym’s specialists to have digital records of members, who can submit logs of meals and workouts, allowing specialists to provide programs and diets through the software to gym members. The software should follow WCAG 2 guidelines and allow notifications of any planned maintenance. This software is also planned to be used in more than one geographical location.

<!-- TECH DEMO --> 
## Demo Site

There is a tech demo for the site setup, the frontend has been hosted for free on vercel as it uses next.js.
The backend is running in an AWS EC2 instance using docker-compose to set up the web server.
</br>
**ITS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE DEMO BELOW HAS SOME SMALL FIXES AND EDITS THAT AREN'T SHOWN IN THIS REPO AS THEY WERE NEEDED TO MAKE IT WORK HOSTING ON VERCEL**
Other Notes:
* In this demo you cannot have admin, trainer or nutritionist accounts, as you won't have access to the database to make staff and associate the users as such.
    * This is also out of concern for others' privacy as being an admin and such may reveal people's names they don't wish to be shared.
    * So features such as making classes, nutritional posts, removing users, and creating programs cannot be shown this way and you will need to set up the program yourself to see this.
* All of the data such as nutritional posts made, and classes are fictional and created by us.
* __We would suggest using fake information when signing up__
    * Phone numbers can be fake as they currently have no use in the system.
    * Emails can be temp emails made with sites like https://tempail.com/en/
* It should also be of note that images may be set to their default placeholder ones if docker container running the backend restarts for any reason

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
* Docker - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ 
    * It may also be beneficial to get docker as this is how we will show you how to get the application running

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JokerZ75/ModernFit-Gym-Group11
   ```
2. Create environment variables
    - In the directory /frontend
        - Create a .env file
        - In the file add
          ```sh
          NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001 (IF YOUR NOT USING THE DOCKER COMPOSE YOU CAN USE WHATEVER PORT YOU LIKE AS LONG AS ITS THE ONE UR BACKEND IS RUNNING ON)
          ```
    - In the directory /backend/src
        - Create a .env file
        - In the file you'll need
          ```sh
          MONGO_URI=<Your Mongodb URI>
          TOKEN_SECRET=<can be anything you want, recommend generating long hex string>
          REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=<can be anything you want, recommend generating long hex string>
          PORT=<port you want the backend to run on>
          EMAIL_PASSWORD=<google gmail app password (for gmail used as EMAIL_USER)>
          EMAIL_USER=<google gmail>
          ```
3. Now go to /backend directory
4. If you have docker installed you should be able to run
```sh
docker compose up --build
```
5. This will launch the backend in a docker container
    - From here you can go to these urls to add the required basic data to ur MongoDB database
    - http://localhost:5001/branch/generate 
    - http://localhost:5001/mealcatagory/data/generate
    - http://localhost:5001/typeofworkout/data/generate
6. Then in a new terminal go to /frontend and run
```sh
npm install
```
7. Then run
```sh
npm run dev
```
8. The frontend should now also be running on localhost:3000 and you can use the application
    - Once you register an account you can go to your database copy your ObjectID
    - Then use it in this link like so  "http://localhost:5001/staff/generate/YOUR OBJECT ID"
    - You will then have a staff account you can choose your role by editing the role attribute in the collection for staff
      ```sh
      The roles available are:
      Nutritionist
      Admin
      Trainer
      ```
9. You could also run them individually using npm if you like. For the backend, you will require Redis (https://redis.io/docs/install/)
