<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our client is ModernFit Gym from Sheffield. Is looking to **_move from a paper-based records system to a modern digital alternative_**.
They pride themselves on fitness and health with several seasoned specialists offering nutritional guidance. The software should allow members and staff alike to sign up to the gym and will provide them with pins to enter gym locations. It will also allow for the gym’s specialists to have digital records of members, who can submit logs of meals and workouts, allowing specialists to provide programs and diets through the software to gym members. The software should follow WCAG 2 guidelines and allow notifications of any planned maintenance. This software is also planned to be used in more than one geographical location.
